# Scripts for downstream analysis
After model evaluation, use scripts below to visualize:
- Code for generating ROC and PR curves: [ROC_curve.py](4.downstream_analysis/ROC_curve.py)
- Code for selecting the optimal classification cut-off of each model:  [optimal_cut-off_selection.py](4.downstream_analysis/optimal_cut-off_selection.py)
